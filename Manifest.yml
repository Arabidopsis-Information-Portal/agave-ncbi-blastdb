# This manifest file is to be used with createBlastDbDockerfile.py
#
# The docker_from section describes a source image
# It must have as its ultimate parent an image in which the BLAST binaries
# are present and usable. For future data volumes, this can point
# to the previously released version because the first iteration
# data container is sourced from araport/agave-ncbi-blast:2.2.30
docker_from:
    registry: "https://hub.docker.com/r/"
    image: araport/agave-ncbi-blastdb # must exist and be accessible
    tag: tair10 # must exist and be accessible
# The docker_to section provides info we need to build the data container
docker_this:

# At present, all source URLs must be uncompressed Fasta but we will add
# support for automatic unarchiving in the future. Dbtype is either prot or
# nucl - other values will cause makeblastdb to fail in the build step
